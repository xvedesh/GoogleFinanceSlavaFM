# POM Java Selenium Test Framework

This project is a scalable Page Object Model (POM) UI testing framework 
with parallel execution capabilities. 
It verifies Google Finance search results across different search engines, 
analyzes portfolios loaded from Excel files by comparing them with Google's suggested portfolios, 
and identifies Google-suggested financial instruments with positive trends present in the loaded 
portfolios. 
The framework supports Selenium Grid in Docker Cloud, utilizing a `driverPool` for initialization, 
enabling scalable and distributed testing environments.
